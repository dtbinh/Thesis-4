This work begins with an overview of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping 
(SLAM).  The goal is to allow the reader to become familiar enough with the
concepts behind SLAM to be able to create their own implementation.  Key ideas 
include the robot model, probabilistic interpretations of motion and 
observation, map representation and Bayes filters.  That is followed by an 
examination of the state of the art, with a focus on Multi-Robot SLAM.  
Particular attention will be paid to least-squares smoothing methods and map 
joining.  Finally, a single step map joining algorithm will be presented and 
applied to the multi-robot case.  Experimental results from both simulated and 
actual robot data will be presented.
