A mobile robot simulator.  

Simulates a unicycle robot with a single arc range bearing sensor.

The robot moves from a series of waypoints and observes features in a spherical
world.  Odometry is recorded as linear and angular velocity.  Observations are
range bearing measurements relative to the robot's pose.
